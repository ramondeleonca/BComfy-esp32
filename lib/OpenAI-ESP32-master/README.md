## OpenAI Library for ESP32 Arduino

[![Library Compilation Test](https://github.com/me-no-dev/OpenAI-ESP32/actions/workflows/lib.yml/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)](https://github.com/me-no-dev/OpenAI-ESP32/actions/workflows/lib.yml?link=http://https://github.com/me-no-dev/OpenAI-ESP32/LIBRARY_TEST.md)

This library currently supports most of the OpenAI API. Exception are `files`, `fine-tunes`.

Examples for almost all endpoints can be found in the `examples` folder.

Library is still in early stages and could sustain some small changes. Some are outlined [here](https://github.com/me-no-dev/OpenAI-ESP32/blob/master/src/OpenAI.cpp#L2-L7)
